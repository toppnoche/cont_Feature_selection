# Feature Selection

Data Preprocessing of high dimentional data set by using feature selection.


## Documentation

[Documentation](https://linktodocumentation)


The dataset used in the above project is "".
After analysing the dataset we observe that the dataset cointains few instances but has high dimention.
A good portion of this dataset is noise and some features might not correspond significant in predicting the output. Moreover the huge dataset will also it much time in processing.
And hence it should be cleaned

1)To reduce the dimentions of dataset and hence prevent overfitting we use feature selection to reduce the number of features.
As there are many redundent features.


2)we will use different techniques of feature selection and see the accuracy by applying linear regression on the contineous values




- For feature selection we use :-
1)Wrapper Methods

2)Filter selection

3)Embeded method
